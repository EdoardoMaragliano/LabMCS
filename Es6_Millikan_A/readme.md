# Es7_Millikan_B – Millikan Oil Drop Experiment (Part B)

This folder continues the analysis of the Millikan oil-drop experiment, with more refined computations and error propagation.

## 📁 Key Files

- `Millikan.py`: python script dependend on ROOT
- `Millikan_standalone.py`: alternative python script, independent of ROOT
- `Millikan.py`: original C++ implementation. Compiling and dependencies are handled via Makefile.

## 🎯 Goal

Extend and improve the data analysis from Part A, including systematic error evaluation and comparison with the expected quantization of charge.
