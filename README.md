# LabMCS ‚Äì Computational Methods for Science

This repository collects exercises, scripts, and projects related to the course **Computational Methods for Science**, focusing on scientific programming applied to physics and mathematics problems.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `Es2_SolarSystem/`: planetary motion simulation
- `Es3_Numerov/`: solving differential equations using the Numerov method
- `Es4_MC/`: Monte Carlo methods for numerical integration
- `Es5_Rydberg/`: data analysis to extract the Rydberg constant
- `Es6_Millikan_A/` and `Es7_Millikan_B/`: Millikan oil-drop experiment data
- `EsFitI/` and `EsFitII/`: curve fitting of experimental data (with/without ROOT)
- `OdeSolverRelativistica/`: relativistic dynamics simulation in C++
- `complessi/`: operations on complex numbers
- `PuntoMateriale/`, `Vettore/`: base classes for physical objects
- `esami-vecchi/`: collection of past exams and quizzes
- Standalone files (`bisezione.py`, `zero.py`, etc.): numerical methods implementations

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- (Optional) ROOT for some fitting scripts
- Common scientific packages: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.

## üéØ Goal

Provide a complete collection of computational exercises on:
- Numerical methods for root finding and integration
- Simulation of classical and relativistic physical systems
- Experimental data fitting and analysis
