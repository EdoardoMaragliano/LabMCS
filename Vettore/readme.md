# Vettore – Vector Class Implementation

This folder defines a 3D vector class with basic vector operations such as addition, scalar product, and cross product.

## 📁 Key Files

- `Vettore.py`: vector class with custom methods and operator overloading
- `test.py`: sample operations using the vector class

## 🎯 Goal

Practice class-based programming and implement foundational tools for physics simulations.
