# PuntoMateriale – Material Point Class

This folder contains a class representing a point mass with properties like position, velocity, and mass.

## 📁 Key Files

- `PuntoMateriale.py`: defines the class and its methods (e.g., kinetic energy)
- `test.py`: test script to create and manipulate point mass objects

## 🎯 Goal

Model physical entities in a modular and reusable way using Python classes.
